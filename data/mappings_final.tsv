Mild cognitive impairment	True	Mild cognitive impairment	Mild cognitive impairment; Memory loss; Delirium dementia and amnestic and other cognitive disorders	The source phenotype 'Mild cognitive impairment' (ICD-9 331.83, ICD-10 G31.84) has an exact name match in the target list. While 'Memory loss' and 'Delirium dementia and amnestic and other cognitive disorders' are related concepts, the verbatim match is the most precise and appropriate mapping.	G31.84
Benign mammary dysplasias	True	Benign mammary dysplasias	Benign mammary dysplasias; Fibroadenosis of breast; Cystic mastopathy; Fibrosclerosis of breast; Other specified benign mammary dysplasias; Other nonmalignant breast conditions	The source phenotype 'Benign mammary dysplasias' (ICD-9 610 series; ICD-10 N60 series) has an exact string match in the UK Biobank candidate list. While several subtypes of this condition (e.g., Fibroadenosis of breast, Cystic mastopathy, Fibrosclerosis of breast) appear in the target list, the parent category 'Benign mammary dysplasias' is the precise semantic and hierarchical equivalent.	N60;N60.0;N60.01;N60.02;N60.09;N60.1;N60.11;N60.12;N60.19;N60.2;N60.21;N60.22;N60.29;N60.3;N60.31;N60.32;N60.39;N60.4;N60.41;N60.42;N60.49;N60.8;N60.81;N60.82;N60.89;N60.9;N60.91;N60.92;N60.99
Other diseases of stomach and duodenum	True	Other disorders of stomach and duodenum	Other disorders of stomach and duodenum; Dyspepsia and other specified disorders of function of stomach; Functional digestive disorders	The source phenotype 'Other diseases of stomach and duodenum' includes ICD-9 codes 536 (Disorders of function of stomach) and 537 (Other disorders of stomach and duodenum) and ICD-10 K31 (Other diseases of stomach and duodenum). The target list contains 'Other disorders of stomach and duodenum', which is a nearly exact string and semantic match for the source name and the K31/537 category. While 'Dyspepsia and other specified disorders of function of stomach' is relevant for the 536 codes, the target 'Other disorders of stomach and duodenum' is the most encompassing and direct match for the source label.

Abnormal cytological findings in specimens from genital organs	True	Abnormal Papanicolaou smear of cervix and cervical HPV	Abnormal Papanicolaou smear of cervix and cervical HPV; Dysplasia of female genital organs; Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] [Cervical dysplasia]; Symptoms involving female genital tract	The source phenotype 'Abnormal cytological findings in specimens from genital organs' is defined by ICD codes (e.g., ICD-9 795.0, ICD-10 R87.61) that specifically refer to abnormal findings on Papanicolaou (Pap) smears and the presence of cervical HPV. The target phenotype 'Abnormal Papanicolaou smear of cervix and cervical HPV' precisely describes this clinical finding and is the most specific and accurate match for the provided definition.	R85.61;R85.610;R85.611;R85.612;R85.613;R85.614;R85.615;R85.616;R85.618;R85.619;R85.81;R85.82;R87.6;R87.61;R87.610;R87.611;R87.612;R87.613;R87.614;R87.615;R87.616;R87.618;R87.619;R87.62;R87.620;R87.621;R87.622;R87.623;R87.624;R87.625;R87.628;R87.629;R87.69;R87.8;R87.81;R87.810;R87.811;R87.82;R87.820;R87.821
Skin changes due to chronic exposure to nonionizing radiation	True	Actinic keratosis	Actinic keratosis; Chronic dermatitis due to solar radiation; Dermatitis due to solar radiation; Skin changes due to chronic exposure to nonionizing radiation	The source phenotype 'Skin changes due to chronic exposure to nonionizing radiation' corresponds directly to the ICD-10 parent code L57. Within this block, the specific condition L57.0 is 'Actinic keratosis', which also corresponds to the provided ICD-9 code 702.0. Actinic keratosis is the most clinically distinct and common pathology in this group. While 'Chronic dermatitis due to solar radiation' is also in the target list (matching ICD-9 692.7x), Actinic keratosis is the preferred match as it captures the specific dermatological lesion (keratosis) defined by the primary codes (702.0/L57.0) and matches the source category (Dermatological), whereas the dermatitis options are categorized under Injuries & Poisonings.	L57;L57.0;L57.1;L57.2;L57.3;L57.4;L57.5;L57.8;L57.9
Abnormal mammogram	True	Abnormal mammogram	Abnormal mammogram; Abnormal findings on mammogram or breast exam; Lump or mass in breast; Other signs and symptoms in breast	The source phenotype 'Abnormal mammogram' has an exact string match in the candidate target list. There is also a broader category 'Abnormal findings on mammogram or breast exam', but the exact match is the most precise mapping.	R92.0;R92.1
Epilepsy recurrent seizures convulsions	True	Epilepsy, recurrent seizures, convulsions	Epilepsy, recurrent seizures, convulsions; Epilepsy; Generalized convulsive epilepsy; Partial epilepsy; Convulsions	The source phenotype 'Epilepsy recurrent seizures convulsions' has an almost exact string match in the target list as 'Epilepsy, recurrent seizures, convulsions'. This target captures the full scope of the source, whereas other options like 'Epilepsy' or 'Convulsions' are either broader or narrower components.	None
Diseases of vocal cords and larynx not elsewhere classified	True	Diseases of the larynx and vocal cords	Diseases of the larynx and vocal cords; Paralysis/spasm of vocal cords or larynx; Voice disturbance; Chronic laryngitis; Acute laryngitis and tracheitis	The source phenotype 'Diseases of vocal cords and larynx not elsewhere classified' has a direct semantic match with the target phenotype 'Diseases of the larynx and vocal cords'. Both represent a broad category of non-malignant conditions affecting the laryngeal structures.	None
Benign neoplasm of the breast	True	Benign neoplasm of breast	Benign neoplasm of breast; Benign mammary dysplasias; Lump or mass in breast; Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of breast; Other specified disorders of breast; Breast disorder NOS	The source phenotype 'Benign neoplasm of the breast' (ICD-10 code D24) matches the target phenotype 'Benign neoplasm of breast' almost exactly in name. While there are other breast-related conditions listed (such as mammary dysplasias or lumps), the best match is the specific diagnostic category for benign neoplasms.	D24;D24.1;D24.2;D24.9
Melanocytic nevi	True	Benign neoplasm of skin	Benign neoplasm of skin; Nevus, non-neoplastic; Vascular hamartomas and non-neoplastic nevi	The source phenotype 'Melanocytic nevi' (commonly known as moles) refers to benign proliferations of melanocytes. In medical coding systems (e.g., ICD-10 D22, ICD-9 216), these are classified as benign neoplasms of the skin. The target list contains 'Benign neoplasm of skin', which is the direct parent category for melanocytic nevi. The alternative 'Nevus, non-neoplastic' typically refers to vascular nevi (such as spider nevi) or other non-tumorous skin anomalies, and melanocytic nevi are technically neoplasms.	None
Myopia	True	Myopia	Myopia; Progressive myopia; Disorders of refraction and accommodation; blindness and low vision	The source phenotype is named 'Myopia' and includes ICD codes for both general myopia (e.g., H52.1, 367.1) and degenerative/pathological myopia (e.g., H44.2, 360.21). The target list contains an exact string match 'Myopia', which is the most precise and appropriate mapping. While 'Progressive myopia' is also listed and relevant to the degenerative codes, the general term 'Myopia' captures the full scope of the source phenotype.	H44.2;H44.20;H44.21;H44.22;H44.23;H44.2A;H44.2A1;H44.2A2;H44.2A3;H44.2A9;H44.2B;H44.2B1;H44.2B2;H44.2B3;H44.2B9;H44.2C;H44.2C1;H44.2C2;H44.2C3;H44.2C9;H44.2D;H44.2D1;H44.2D2;H44.2D3;H44.2D9;H44.2E;H44.2E1;H44.2E2;H44.2E3;H44.2E9;H52.1;H52.10;H52.11;H52.12;H52.13
Multinodular goiter	True	Nontoxic nodular goiter	Nontoxic nodular goiter; Toxic multinodular goiter; Simple and unspecified goiter; Nontoxic uninodular goiter; Thyrotoxicosis with or without goiter; Other disorders of thyroid	The source phenotype 'Multinodular goiter' includes ICD codes for both nontoxic (ICD-9 241.1) and toxic (ICD-9 242.2) forms. However, the unqualified name 'Multinodular goiter' typically refers to the structural condition (nontoxic/NOS) unless specified as toxic. In the UK Biobank list, 'Nontoxic multinodular goiter' is not explicitly listed, but 'Nontoxic nodular goiter' is present and typically subsumes nontoxic multinodular goiter (ICD-9 241.1). While 'Toxic multinodular goiter' is also in the list and covers the toxic subset, 'Nontoxic nodular goiter' is the better match for the primary label and the nontoxic component, which is the default classification for 'Multinodular goiter' without functional qualifiers.	E01.1;E04.2;E05.2;E05.20;E05.21
Skin changes due to solar radiation	True	Dermatitis due to solar radiation	Dermatitis due to solar radiation; Chronic dermatitis due to solar radiation; Actinic keratosis	The source phenotype 'Skin changes due to solar radiation' is defined by ICD-9 692.7 (titled 'Dermatitis due to solar radiation') and ICD-10 codes L55-L57 covering both acute (sunburn) and chronic skin changes due to UV. The target candidate 'Dermatitis due to solar radiation' is a direct string and clinical synonym for the primary ICD-9 code provided. While 'Actinic keratosis' and 'Chronic dermatitis due to solar radiation' are also partial matches included in the source definition (via 702.0 and L57), 'Dermatitis due to solar radiation' is the most representative label for the broad category of solar-induced skin changes described by the code list.	L55;L55.0;L55.1;L55.2;L55.9;L56;L56.0;L56.1;L56.2;L56.3;L56.4;L56.5;L56.8;L56.9;L57;L57.0;L57.1;L57.2;L57.3;L57.4;L57.5;L57.8;L57.9
Malignant neoplasm of the breast	True	Breast cancer	Breast cancer; Malignant neoplasm of female breast; Breast cancer [female]; Neoplasm of uncertain behavior of breast	"The source phenotype ""Malignant neoplasm of the breast"" encompasses both female (ICD-9 174) and male (ICD-9 175) breast cancers, as well as carcinoma in situ. The target list provides ""Breast cancer"", which is a direct, gender-neutral synonym covering the malignant pathology described. Other options like ""Malignant neoplasm of female breast"" and ""Breast cancer [female]"" are overly specific given the inclusion of male codes in the source."	C50;C50.0;C50.01;C50.011;C50.012;C50.019;C50.02;C50.021;C50.022;C50.029;C50.1;C50.11;C50.111;C50.112;C50.119;C50.12;C50.121;C50.122;C50.129;C50.2;C50.21;C50.211;C50.212;C50.219;C50.22;C50.221;C50.222;C50.229;C50.3;C50.31;C50.311;C50.312;C50.319;C50.32;C50.321;C50.322;C50.329;C50.4;C50.41;C50.411;C50.412;C50.419;C50.42;C50.421;C50.422;C50.429;C50.5;C50.51;C50.511;C50.512;C50.519;C50.52;C50.521;C50.522;C50.529;C50.6;C50.61;C50.611;C50.612;C50.619;C50.62;C50.621;C50.622;C50.629;C50.8;C50.81;C50.811;C50.812;C50.819;C50.82;C50.821;C50.822;C50.829;C50.9;C50.91;C50.911;C50.912;C50.919;C50.92;C50.921;C50.922;C50.929;D05;D05.0;D05.00;D05.01;D05.02;D05.1;D05.10;D05.11;D05.12;D05.8;D05.80;D05.81;D05.82;D05.9;D05.90;D05.91;D05.92;D48.6;D48.60;D48.61;D48.62;D49.3;Z85.3;Z86.000
Malignant neoplasm of the breast female	True	Malignant neoplasm of female breast	Malignant neoplasm of female breast; Breast cancer [female]; Breast cancer	The source phenotype 'Malignant neoplasm of the breast female' maps directly to the target 'Malignant neoplasm of female breast'. Both terms denote cancer of the breast specifically in female patients, using nearly identical clinical terminology (Malignant neoplasm). 'Breast cancer [female]' is also an exact semantic match.	None
Hypertrophic conditions of skin	True	Other hypertrophic and atrophic conditions of skin	Other hypertrophic and atrophic conditions of skin; Keloid scar; Scar conditions and fibrosis of skin; Keloid scar; Changes in skin texture	The source phenotype 'Hypertrophic conditions of skin' encompasses a range of codes including those for keloid scars (ICD-9 701.4, ICD-10 L91.0), hypertrophic disorders (L91), and scar conditions/fibrosis (ICD-9 709.2, ICD-10 L90.5). The candidate target list contains specific entries for 'Keloid scar' and 'Scar conditions and fibrosis of skin', but also a broader category 'Other hypertrophic and atrophic conditions of skin'. This latter target provides the best semantic match to the source name, specifically covering the 'Hypertrophic' descriptor and likely acting as a grouping for the mixed codes provided (L90 and L91 series).	L90.5;L91;L91.0;L91.8;L91.9;L98.5
Abnormal Papanicolaou smear	True	Abnormal Papanicolaou smear of cervix and cervical HPV	Abnormal Papanicolaou smear of cervix and cervical HPV; Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] [Cervical dysplasia]; Cervical cancer and dysplasia; Symptoms involving female genital tract; Noninflammatory disorders of cervix	The source phenotype 'Abnormal Papanicolaou smear' refers to abnormal cytological findings from a cervical screening test, defined by ICD codes such as 795.0x (Abnormal Papanicolaou smear of cervix) and R87.6x (Abnormal cytological findings). The target phenotype 'Abnormal Papanicolaou smear of cervix and cervical HPV' is a precise semantic match, explicitly naming the specific test and the finding. While 'Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia' and 'Cervical cancer and dysplasia' are related diagnoses, the selected target accurately represents the screening result phenotype described by the source.	R85.610;R85.611;R85.612;R85.613;R85.614;R87.610;R87.611;R87.612;R87.613;R87.614;R87.62;R87.620;R87.621;R87.622;R87.623;R87.624;R87.69
Rosacea	True	Rosacea	Rosacea; Unspecified erythematous condition; Erythematous conditions; Other specified erythematous conditions	The source phenotype 'Rosacea' has an exact string match in the target list. This is the specific and correct mapping for ICD-10 code L71. Broader categories such as 'Erythematous conditions' are related but less precise.	H10.82;H10.821;H10.822;H10.823;H10.829;L71;L71.0;L71.1;L71.8;L71.9
Pain in shoulder	True	Pain in joint	Pain in joint; Pain in limb; Symptoms and disorders of the joints	The source phenotype 'Pain in shoulder' is defined by ICD-9 code 719.41 and ICD-10 code M25.51. These codes fall under the parent category of 'Pain in joint' (719.4 and M25.5). Since the UK Biobank candidate list does not have a specific entry for 'Pain in shoulder' or 'Shoulder pain', the direct parent concept 'Pain in joint' is the most accurate and clinically appropriate match.	M25.51;M25.511;M25.512;M25.519
Nonspecific reaction to test for tuberculosis	True	Other immunological findings	Other immunological findings; Tuberculosis; Nonspecific findings on examination of blood	The source phenotype 'Nonspecific reaction to test for tuberculosis' corresponds to ICD-10 code R76.1 and ICD-9 795.5. These codes fall under the ICD parent category of 'Other abnormal immunological findings in serum' (R76). The target list contains 'Other immunological findings', which is a direct semantic and hierarchical match for this category. While 'Tuberculosis' is the related disease, a nonspecific test reaction (like a positive Mantoux or IGRA) indicates exposure, latent infection, or BCG vaccination, not necessarily active disease; thus, mapping to the finding/result category is more accurate than mapping to the disease itself.	R76.1;R76.11;R76.12
Lump or mass in breast or nonspecific abnormal breast exam	True	Lump or mass in breast	Lump or mass in breast; Abnormal findings on mammogram or breast exam; Abnormal mammogram; Other signs and symptoms in breast; Breast disorder NOS	The source phenotype is defined by ICD-10 N63 (Lump in breast) and R92 (Abnormal and inconclusive findings on diagnostic imaging of breast). The target list contains specific matches for both components: 'Lump or mass in breast' (matches N63 and the first half of the source name) and 'Abnormal findings on mammogram or breast exam' (matches R92). 'Lump or mass in breast' is selected as the best match because it corresponds verbatim to the primary description in the source name and represents the specific physical finding (N63) which often drives the clinical encounter, whereas the abnormal findings category is broader and often focuses on imaging.	N63;N63.0;N63.1;N63.10;N63.11;N63.12;N63.13;N63.14;N63.15;N63.2;N63.20;N63.21;N63.22;N63.23;N63.24;N63.25;N63.3;N63.31;N63.32;N63.4;N63.41;N63.42;R92.0;R92.1;R92.2;R92.8
Benign sarcoma related cancers	True	Other benign neoplasm of connective and other soft tissue	Other benign neoplasm of connective and other soft tissue; Lipoma; Lipoma of skin and subcutaneous tissue; Benign neoplasm of bone and articular cartilage	The source phenotype 'Benign sarcoma related cancers' is an awkward phrasing likely referring to benign neoplasms arising from connective and soft tissues (the same tissue types that give rise to sarcomas, which are malignant). The target phenotype 'Other benign neoplasm of connective and other soft tissue' is the closest categorical match for benign tumors of these tissue types.	None
Other skin and subcutaneous disorders	True	Disorder of skin and subcutaneous tissue NOS	Disorder of skin and subcutaneous tissue NOS; Other hypertrophic and atrophic conditions of skin; Degenerative skin conditions and other dermatoses; Scar conditions and fibrosis of skin; Other specified diseases of hair and hair follicles	The source phenotype 'Other skin and subcutaneous disorders' is an aggregate category comprising ICD codes for hypertrophic/atrophic conditions (ICD-9 701), other dermatoses (ICD-9 702), and other disorders of skin (ICD-9 709, ICD-10 L98). The UK Biobank candidate list contains specific matches for these subgroups (e.g., 'Other hypertrophic and atrophic conditions of skin', 'Degenerative skin conditions and other dermatoses'). However, 'Disorder of skin and subcutaneous tissue NOS' provides the best semantic match for the broad source label and covers the residual codes (709/L98) explicitly mentioned in the source.	L44.4;L87.1;L94;L94.8;L94.9;L98;L98.6;L98.8;L98.9;L99
Goiter	True	Simple and unspecified goiter	Simple and unspecified goiter; Nontoxic nodular goiter; Nontoxic uninodular goiter; Nontoxic multinodular goiter; Toxic multinodular goiter; Thyrotoxicosis with or without goiter	The source phenotype 'Goiter' is a broad category defined by ICD codes covering simple, nontoxic nodular, and toxic goiters (ICD-9 240-242). The target list splits these into specific subtypes (e.g., 'Nontoxic nodular goiter', 'Thyrotoxicosis with or without goiter'). 'Simple and unspecified goiter' is the best match because it aligns most closely with the generic source name, serving as the default category for the term 'Goiter' when a broad inclusive category is not available in the target vocabulary, although the source concept is technically a superset of this target.	E01.0;E01.1;E01.2;E03.0;E04;E04.0;E04.1;E04.2;E04.8;E04.9;E05.0;E05.00;E05.01;E05.1;E05.10;E05.11;E05.2;E05.20;E05.21;E05.3;E05.30;E05.31;E07.1;P72.0
Cutaneous cyst	True	Sebaceous cyst	Sebaceous cyst; Localized superficial swelling, mass, or lump	The source phenotype 'Cutaneous cyst' is defined by ICD-9 codes 704.4 and 706.2, and ICD-10 codes L72.x. Specifically, ICD-9 706.2 and ICD-10 L72.3 refer to 'Sebaceous cyst'. While the source term 'Cutaneous cyst' is a broader header for follicular cysts (including epidermal and pilar cysts), 'Sebaceous cyst' is the closest specific entity available in the UK Biobank target list that directly corresponds to one of the primary ICD codes (706.2/L72.3) included in the source definition.	L72.0;L72.1;L72.11;L72.12;L72.3
Morbid obesity	True	Obesity	Obesity; Overweight, obesity and other hyperalimentation	The source phenotype is 'Morbid obesity', which is a severe classification of obesity defined by specific BMI thresholds (ICD-9 278.01, ICD-10 E66.01). The target list does not contain an exact entry for 'Morbid obesity'. The best available match is 'Obesity', which is the direct parent concept encompassing morbid obesity. The alternative match 'Overweight, obesity and other hyperalimentation' is a broader grouping that is less specific to the condition than 'Obesity'.	E66.01;E66.2;Z68.4;Z68.41;Z68.42;Z68.43;Z68.44;Z68.45
Aphagia and dysphagia	True	Dysphagia	Dysphagia; Diseases of esophagus; Symptoms involving digestive system	The source phenotype 'Aphagia and dysphagia' is defined by ICD codes such as 787.2 and R13, which correspond to difficulty swallowing. The target list contains the exact concept 'Dysphagia' [Category: digestive], which is the medical term for this condition and directly covers the provided ICD codes.	D50.1;R13;R13.0;R13.1;R13.10;R13.11;R13.12;R13.13;R13.14;R13.19
Scar conditions and fibrosis of skin	True	Scar conditions and fibrosis of skin	Scar conditions and fibrosis of skin; Keloid scar	The target list contains an exact string match for the source phenotype 'Scar conditions and fibrosis of skin'. 'Keloid scar' is also a relevant match but represents a specific subtype, whereas the best match covers the full scope of the source definition.	L90.5
Sebaceous cyst Epidermal cyst	True	Sebaceous cyst	Sebaceous cyst; Diseases of sebaceous glands; Localized superficial swelling, mass, or lump	The source phenotype is listed as 'Sebaceous cyst Epidermal cyst'. The target list contains an exact string match for 'Sebaceous cyst'. In many medical coding contexts (like ICD-9 706.2), 'Sebaceous cyst' is the catch-all term used to classify epidermal inclusion cysts, pilar cysts, and steatomas. Therefore, 'Sebaceous cyst' is the precise mapping.	None
Diastolic heart failure	True	Congestive heart failure (CHF) NOS	Heart failure NOS; Congestive heart failure (CHF) NOS; Congestive heart failure; nonhypertensive; Other forms of chronic heart disease	The source phenotype is 'Diastolic heart failure' (ICD-10 I50.3, 'Diastolic (congestive) heart failure'). The target list does not contain a specific entry for diastolic heart failure (or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction). The target list does contain 'Congestive heart failure (CHF) NOS' and 'Heart failure NOS'. Since ICD-10 classifies I50.3 as 'Diastolic (congestive) heart failure' and it falls under the broader umbrella of congestive heart failure in many phenotype grouping schemas (such as PheCodes where 428 includes 428.3), 'Congestive heart failure (CHF) NOS' is the best available hierarchical match covering this specific subtype.	I50.3;I50.30;I50.31;I50.32;I50.33
Diverticula of colon	True	Diverticulosis and diverticulitis	Diverticulosis and diverticulitis; Diverticulosis	The source phenotype 'Diverticula of colon' includes ICD codes for both diverticulosis (562.10, K57.30) and diverticulitis (562.11, K57.32). The target phenotype 'Diverticulosis and diverticulitis' captures the full spectrum of these conditions. While 'Diverticulosis' is a candidate, it is narrower than the source definition which explicitly includes inflammatory states (diverticulitis).	K38.2;K57.20;K57.21;K57.3;K57.30;K57.31;K57.32;K57.33
Other follicular disorders	True	Other specified diseases of hair and hair follicles	Other specified diseases of hair and hair follicles; Diseases of sebaceous glands; Acne; Pilonidal cyst; Sebaceous cyst; Hidradenitis	"The source phenotype ""Other follicular disorders"" is explicitly named after the ICD-10 block L73 (""Other follicular disorders""), which is included in the code list. This block maps to ICD-9 704.8 (""Other specified diseases of hair and hair follicles""). While the source phenotype also aggregates related pilosebaceous conditions like Acne (L70) and Pilonidal cysts (L05) which have their own specific targets, the target ""Other specified diseases of hair and hair follicles"" is the most precise semantic and code-based match for the specific ""Other follicular"" designation."

Nonspecific abnormal findings on radiological and other examination of musculoskeletal system	True	Nonspecific abnormal findings on radiological and other examination of musculoskeletal system	Nonspecific abnormal findings on radiological and other examination of musculoskeletal system	The candidate target list contains an exact string match for the source phenotype. This target aligns perfectly with the ICD-9 code 793.7 and ICD-10 codes R93.6 and R93.7 provided in the source description.	R93.6;R93.7
Benign neoplasm of the skin	True	Benign neoplasm of skin	Benign neoplasm of skin; Nevus, non-neoplastic; Vascular hamartomas and non-neoplastic nevi; Seborrheic keratosis	The source phenotype 'Benign neoplasm of the skin' corresponds perfectly to the target phenotype 'Benign neoplasm of skin'. The source ICD codes (D22 for Melanocytic nevi and D23 for Other benign neoplasms of skin) are the standard definitions for benign skin neoplasms. While 'Nevus, non-neoplastic' and 'Vascular hamartomas and non-neoplastic nevi' appear in the target list and overlap with specific codes in the source (like I78.1), 'Benign neoplasm of skin' is the direct, comprehensive match for the named condition.	D22;D22.0;D22.1;D22.10;D22.11;D22.111;D22.112;D22.12;D22.121;D22.122;D22.2;D22.20;D22.21;D22.22;D22.3;D22.30;D22.39;D22.4;D22.5;D22.6;D22.60;D22.61;D22.62;D22.7;D22.70;D22.71;D22.72;D22.9;D23;D23.0;D23.1;D23.10;D23.11;D23.111;D23.112;D23.12;D23.121;D23.122;D23.2;D23.20;D23.21;D23.22;D23.3;D23.30;D23.39;D23.4;D23.5;D23.6;D23.60;D23.61;D23.62;D23.7;D23.70;D23.71;D23.72;D23.9;I78.1;Q82.5
Chronic fatigue syndrome	True	Chronic fatigue syndrome	Chronic fatigue syndrome; Malaise and fatigue	The target list contains an exact string match for 'Chronic fatigue syndrome', which corresponds perfectly to the source phenotype name and its ICD definitions (ICD-9 780.71, ICD-10 G93.3). While 'Malaise and fatigue' is semantically related, it represents a broader symptom category, making the specific syndrome match the superior choice.	G93.3;G93.31;G93.32;G93.39;R53.82
Uninodular goiter single thyroid nodule	True	Nontoxic uninodular goiter	Nontoxic uninodular goiter; Nontoxic nodular goiter; Simple and unspecified goiter; Other disorders of thyroid	The source phenotype 'Uninodular goiter single thyroid nodule' refers to a single nodule within the thyroid gland. The target 'Nontoxic uninodular goiter' is the specific clinical term for a single thyroid nodule (ICD-10 code E04.1 is titled 'Nontoxic single thyroid nodule' or 'Nontoxic uninodular goiter'). This is a more precise match than the broader 'Nontoxic nodular goiter' or 'Simple and unspecified goiter'.	None
Generalized anxiety disorder	True	Generalized anxiety disorder	Generalized anxiety disorder; Anxiety disorders; Anxiety disorder	The source phenotype 'Generalized anxiety disorder' (ICD-9 300.02, ICD-10 F41.1) has an exact string match in the target list. Broader terms such as 'Anxiety disorder' and 'Anxiety disorders' are also present, but the specific diagnosis is the optimal match.	F41.1
Cerebral infarction Ischemic stroke	True	Cerebral artery occlusion, with cerebral infarction	Cerebral artery occlusion, with cerebral infarction; Occlusion of cerebral arteries; Cerebrovascular disease; Cerebral ischemia; Occlusion and stenosis of precerebral arteries	The source phenotype 'Cerebral infarction Ischemic stroke' refers to tissue death in the brain caused by a blockage in blood supply. The candidate 'Cerebral artery occlusion, with cerebral infarction' explicitly captures both the cause (occlusion) and the result (infarction), making it the precise synonymous term for ischemic stroke in this list.	None
Alopecia Areata	True	Alopecia	Alopecia; Diseases of hair and hair follicles; Other specified diseases of hair and hair follicles	The source phenotype is 'Alopecia Areata', a specific autoimmune form of hair loss (ICD-10 L63). The target list includes 'Alopecia', which is the general medical term for hair loss and encompasses Alopecia Areata. Since there is no specific entry for 'Alopecia Areata' in the target list, 'Alopecia' is the most accurate and specific match available.	L63;L63.0;L63.1;L63.2;L63.8;L63.9
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder	True	Premenstrual tension syndromes	Premenstrual tension syndromes; Disorders of menstruation and other abnormal bleeding from female genital tract; Mood disorders	The source phenotype 'Premenstrual dysphoric disorder' corresponds to ICD-9 code 625.4 and ICD-10 code N94.3. In the target list, 'Premenstrual tension syndromes' is the direct label for these specific ICD codes. Although PMDD is a severe form with distinct psychiatric classification (F32.81), it falls under the umbrella of premenstrual tension syndromes in many coding systems (specifically sharing the N94.3/625.4 codes), making this the most accurate specific match.	F32.81;N94.3
Viral infections	True	Viral infection	Viral infection; Viral warts & HPV; Viral hepatitis; Viral hepatitis A; Viral hepatitis B; Viral hepatitis C; Viral Enteritis; Influenza; Herpes simplex; Herpes zoster; Eye infection, viral; Varicella infection; Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease; HIV infection, symptomatic; Viral pneumonia	The source phenotype 'Viral infections' represents a broad category of diseases caused by viruses, supported by a wide range of ICD codes covering unspecified viral infections (e.g., ICD-10 B34), influenza, herpes, hepatitis, and others. The target candidate 'Viral infection' provides a direct semantic match to this broad concept. While the target list contains specific viral diseases (e.g., 'Influenza', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Herpes zoster'), the general term 'Viral infection' is the most accurate mapping for the aggregate source phenotype.

Hypothyroidism not specified as secondary	True	Hypothyroidism NOS	Hypothyroidism NOS; Hypothyroidism; Acquired hypothyroidism; Secondary hypothyroidism	The source phenotype 'Hypothyroidism not specified as secondary' refers to a diagnosis of hypothyroidism where a specific underlying cause (such as a secondary cause) is not defined. In medical terminology and coding (ICD), 'Not Specified' is synonymous with 'Not Otherwise Specified' (NOS). Therefore, 'Hypothyroidism NOS' is the most precise semantic match. 'Secondary hypothyroidism' is explicitly excluded by the source name, and 'Hypothyroidism' is a valid but slightly less specific synonym in this context.	None
Osteoporosis	True	Osteoporosis, osteopenia and pathological fracture	Osteoporosis, osteopenia and pathological fracture; Osteoporosis NOS; Other specified osteoporosis; Pathologic fracture	The source phenotype 'Osteoporosis' includes a comprehensive list of ICD codes for Osteoporosis with pathological fracture (M80 series) and Osteoporosis without pathological fracture (M81 series, ICD-9 733.0). The candidate target 'Osteoporosis, osteopenia and pathological fracture' is the best fit because it acts as a combined category covering both the disease process and the associated fractures present in the source codes. While 'Osteoporosis NOS' is a close name match, it is potentially too narrow or distinct from the fracture codes (M80) which constitute a large portion of the source definition.

Conjunctivitis	True	Disorders of conjunctiva	Disorders of conjunctiva; Conjunctivitis, infectious; Inflammation of the eye; Pain, swelling or discharge of eye; Eye infection, viral	The source phenotype 'Conjunctivitis' includes various forms of the condition, such as infectious (viral, bacterial), allergic, and unspecified conjunctivitis (indicated by ICD-10 codes H10, B30, etc.). The target list contains 'Conjunctivitis, infectious', but this is too narrow as it excludes allergic or chemical causes present in the source. 'Disorders of conjunctiva' is the broader taxonomic category that encompasses all forms of conjunctivitis (ICD-9 code block 372 and ICD-10 block H10 fall under this heading), making it the most accurate and inclusive match available.

Sensorineural hearing loss	True	Sensorineural hearing loss	Sensorineural hearing loss; Hearing loss	The source phenotype 'Sensorineural hearing loss' has an exact string match in the target candidate list. While 'Hearing loss' is also available, it is a broader category, making the specific 'Sensorineural hearing loss' item the optimal choice.	H90.3;H90.4;H90.41;H90.42;H90.5;H90.A2;H90.A21;H90.A22;H91.1;H91.10;H91.11;H91.12;H91.13
Flat foot pes planus	True	Flat foot	Flat foot; Acquired foot deformities; Congenital deformities of feet	The source phenotype 'Flat foot pes planus' refers to the lowering of the longitudinal arch of the foot. The candidate list contains the specific entry 'Flat foot', which is a direct synonym for pes planus and represents the exact same clinical concept.	None
Urge incontinence	True	Urinary incontinence	Urinary incontinence; Functional disorders of bladder; Other disorders of bladder; Other abnormality of urination	The source phenotype 'Urge incontinence' is a specific type of urinary incontinence characterized by a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by an involuntary loss of urine. The target list contains the broader category 'Urinary incontinence', which subsumes urge incontinence. While 'stress incontinence, female' is also in the list, it is a distinct subtype of incontinence and thus not the correct match. Therefore, 'Urinary incontinence' is the most accurate and specific available match.	N39.41
Flatulence eructation and gas pain	True	Flatulence	Flatulence; Symptoms involving digestive system; Functional digestive disorders; Abdominal pain; Dyspepsia and other specified disorders of function of stomach	The source phenotype 'Flatulence eructation and gas pain' corresponds to symptoms associated with excess gas in the gastrointestinal tract. In medical coding (e.g., ICD-10 R14), these specific symptoms (flatulence, eructation, and gas pain) are grouped together. The target list contains the specific phenotype 'Flatulence', which serves as the direct mapping for this cluster of gas-related symptoms.	None
Renal tubulo interstitial diseases	True	Nephritis and nephropathy without mention of glomerulonephritis	Nephritis and nephropathy without mention of glomerulonephritis; Pyelonephritis; Nephritis; nephrosis; renal sclerosis; Other disorders of the kidney and ureters; Glomerulonephritis; Chronic glomerulonephritis, NOS; Non-proliferative glomerulonephritis	The source phenotype 'Renal tubulo interstitial diseases' (ICD-10 block N10-N16) refers to kidney diseases affecting the tubules and interstitium, distinct from glomerular diseases. The target 'Nephritis and nephropathy without mention of glomerulonephritis' is the best semantic match because it describes kidney inflammation (nephritis) while explicitly excluding glomerular causes, which is the defining characteristic of tubulo-interstitial nephritis. While 'Pyelonephritis' is a specific subset (infectious) within this category, the selected target is broader and conceptually equivalent to the general non-glomerular nephritis group.	None
Abnormal findings on diagnostic test of central nervous system	True	Nonspecific abnormal findings on radiological and other examination of skull and head	Nonspecific abnormal findings on radiological and other examination of skull and head	The source phenotype 'Abnormal findings on diagnostic test of central nervous system' encompasses ICD codes for abnormal radiological findings (ICD-9 793.0, ICD-10 R90, R93.0) and abnormal function studies (ICD-9 794.0, ICD-10 R94.0) of the CNS/head. The target phenotype 'Nonspecific abnormal findings on radiological and other examination of skull and head' is a text-based match for ICD-9 793.0. Although the source is slightly broader (including function studies like EEGs), this target is the closest specific match available that describes abnormal diagnostic/examination findings in the relevant anatomical region.	R90;R90.0;R90.8;R90.81;R90.82;R90.89;R93.0;R94.0;R94.01;R94.02;R94.09
Malignant neoplasm of other and ill defined sites	True	Malignant neoplasm, other	Malignant neoplasm, other; Cancer, suspected or other; Malignant neoplasm of other and ill-defined sites within the digestive organs and peritoneum	The source phenotype 'Malignant neoplasm of other and ill defined sites' corresponds to ICD categories (e.g., ICD-10 C76, ICD-9 195) for cancers where the site is ill-defined or not specified elsewhere. The target phenotype 'Malignant neoplasm, other' is the standard generalized label for this category in the target list, capturing malignancies not assigned to a specific organ or system.	None
Benign neoplasm of the head and neck	True	Benign neoplasm of lip, oral cavity, and pharynx	Benign neoplasm of lip, oral cavity, and pharynx; Benign neoplasm of respiratory and intrathoracic organs; Nasal polyps; Diseases of the salivary glands	The source phenotype 'Benign neoplasm of the head and neck' defines a group of non-cancerous growths in the oral cavity, pharynx, salivary glands, larynx, and nasal cavities, indicated by ICD-9 210/212 and ICD-10 D10/D11/D14. The target list does not possess a single category encompassing all head and neck benign neoplasms. 'Benign neoplasm of lip, oral cavity, and pharynx' is selected as the best match because it directly corresponds to the first and primary set of ICD codes provided (210 and D10) and represents the core anatomical region often implied by 'Head and Neck' classifications. Other candidates like 'Benign neoplasm of respiratory and intrathoracic organs' or 'Nasal polyps' cover only the respiratory sub-components (larynx, nasal) of the source definition.

Migraine	True	Migraine	Migraine; Migrain with aura	The source phenotype 'Migraine' encompasses the full range of migraine disorders (ICD-9 346.x, ICD-10 G43.x). The target list contains an exact string match 'Migraine' which is the most direct and accurate mapping. While 'Migrain with aura' is present, it represents a specific subtype, whereas the source is the general condition.

Urinary incontinence and enuresis	True	Urinary incontinence	Urinary incontinence; stress incontinence, female; Other abnormality of urination; Functional disorders of bladder	The source phenotype 'Urinary incontinence and enuresis' encompasses involuntary urination. The target list contains 'Urinary incontinence', which is a direct match for the primary condition and covers the majority of the provided ICD codes (e.g., N39.4, R32, 788.3). While 'stress incontinence, female' is also a match, it represents a specific subtype included in the source but is too narrow to be the best match for the broader category.

Abnormality of urination	True	Other abnormality of urination	Other abnormality of urination; Dysuria; Urinary incontinence; Retention of urine; Frequency of urination and polyuria; Other symptoms involving urinary system; Other symptoms/disorders or the urinary system; Urinary obstruction; Other symptoms/disorders or the urinary system	The source phenotype 'Abnormality of urination' aggregates a wide range of urinary symptoms (ICD-9 788.x/ICD-10 R30-R39) including dysuria, incontinence, retention, and frequency. The UK Biobank target list splits these into specific phenotypes (e.g., 'Dysuria', 'Urinary incontinence', 'Retention of urine'). The target 'Other abnormality of urination' provides the closest lexical match to the source name, although strictly speaking, the source acts as a broad parent category ('Symptoms involving urinary system') while the target is likely the specific subset (ICD 788.6). Given the constraint to choose a single best match and the exact phrasing of the source, 'Other abnormality of urination' is selected.	F98.0;N39.3;N39.4;N39.41;N39.42;N39.43;N39.44;N39.45;N39.46;N39.49;N39.490;N39.491;N39.492;N39.498;R30;R30.0;R30.1;R30.9;R32;R33;R33.0;R33.8;R33.9;R34;R35;R35.0;R35.1;R35.8;R35.81;R35.89;R39.0;R39.1;R39.11;R39.12;R39.13;R39.14;R39.15;R39.16;R39.19;R39.191;R39.192;R39.198;R39.81
Pure hypercholesterolemia	True	Hypercholesterolemia	Hypercholesterolemia; Hyperlipidemia; Lipoprotein disorders; Disorders of lipoid metabolism; Mixed hyperlipidemia	The source phenotype 'Pure hypercholesterolemia' (ICD-10 E78.0) is specifically defined by elevated cholesterol. The target list contains the exact term 'Hypercholesterolemia', which is the most specific and direct match. While 'Hyperlipidemia' and 'Lipoprotein disorders' are related, they are broader categories that include triglyceride disorders.	E78.0;E78.00
Acquired deformities of limbs	True	Other acquired deformities of limbs	Other acquired deformities of limbs; Acquired foot deformities; Acquired toe deformities; Acquired deformities of finger; Other acquired musculoskeletal deformity; Flat foot; Hammer toe (acquired); Hallux valgus (Bunion); Hallux rigidus	The source phenotype 'Acquired deformities of limbs' is defined by ICD-9 code 736 and ICD-10 code M21, both of which are titled 'Other acquired deformities of limbs' in their respective coding manuals. The UK Biobank list contains a target with the exact text 'Other acquired deformities of limbs', which serves as a direct and precise match for this category. Other matches like 'Acquired foot deformities' or 'Acquired deformities of finger' are subsets of this broader category.

Abnormal findings on examination of blood	True	Nonspecific findings on examination of blood	Nonspecific findings on examination of blood; Other diseases of blood and blood-forming organs	The source phenotype is defined by the name 'Abnormal findings on examination of blood' and ICD-9 code 790. The candidate target 'Nonspecific findings on examination of blood' is the exact standard description for ICD-9 code 790. While 'Other diseases of blood and blood-forming organs' exists, it refers to specific hematological disorders (ICD-9 289 / ICD-10 D70-D77) rather than the nonspecific laboratory findings described by the source.	R70.1;R79;R79.0;R79.8;R79.81;R79.83;R79.89;R79.9
Disorder of nervous system	True	Other and unspecified disorders of the nervous system	Other and unspecified disorders of the nervous system; Neurological disorders; Other conditions of brain; Other conditions of brain, NOS	The source phenotype 'Disorder of nervous system' is defined by ICD-9 code 349 and ICD-10 code G98. The standard ICD-9 title for code 349 is 'Other and unspecified disorders of the nervous system'. The candidate target list contains this exact description, making it the most precise semantic and code-based match.

Chest pain on breathing	True	Painful respiration	Painful respiration; Nonspecific chest pain; Precordial pain; Symptoms involving respiratory system and other chest symptoms	The source phenotype 'Chest pain on breathing' is directly mapped to ICD-9 786.52 and ICD-10 R07.1. The candidate target 'Painful respiration' is the standard clinical description for ICD-9 786.52 and is semantically identical to chest pain that occurs or worsens upon breathing. While 'Nonspecific chest pain' is related, it is a broader category (typically R07.4) that does not specify the respiratory component.	R07.1;R07.81
Disorders of the middle ear	False	Other disorders of middle ear and mastoid	Other disorders of middle ear and mastoid; Otitis media; Suppurative and unspecified otitis media; Otitis media and Eustachian tube disorders; Cholesteatoma; Otosclerosis; Perforation of tympanic membrane; Eustachian tube disorders; Tympanosclerosis and middle ear disease related to otitis media; Other disorders of tympanic membrane; Mastoiditis & related conditions	The Source Phenotype 'Disorders of the middle ear' is a broad, aggregated concept that includes several specific conditions such as Otitis Media, Eustachian tube disorders, Cholesteatoma, Otosclerosis, and Tympanic membrane disorders (evidenced by the comprehensive list of ICD codes provided). The Target List (UK Biobank) represents these conditions as separate, granular phenotypes. While 'Other disorders of middle ear and mastoid' is the closest lexical match, it serves as a residual category in the target ontology (excluding the named specific disorders), whereas the source phenotype encompasses them. Therefore, there is no single target phenotype that covers the full scope of the source.

Skin symptoms	True	Symptoms affecting skin	Symptoms affecting skin; Pruritus and related conditions; Rash and other nonspecific skin eruption; Changes in skin texture; Disturbance of skin sensation; Disorder of skin and subcutaneous tissue NOS	The source phenotype 'Skin symptoms' is defined by a broad range of ICD codes including general skin symptoms (ICD-9 782, ICD-10 R23), rash (ICD-9 782.1, ICD-10 R21), and pruritus (ICD-9 698, ICD-10 L29). The candidate target 'Symptoms affecting skin' provides a direct linguistic and categorical match to the source name. While the target list also contains more specific symptom categories found in the source definition (e.g., 'Pruritus and related conditions', 'Rash and other nonspecific skin eruption'), 'Symptoms affecting skin' is the most appropriate overarching label for the aggregate source phenotype.

Epidermal thickening	True	Other hypertrophic and atrophic conditions of skin	Other hypertrophic and atrophic conditions of skin; Corns and callosities; Keratoderma, acquired; Acquired acanthosis nigricans	The source phenotype 'Epidermal thickening' aggregates several conditions characterized by thickening of the skin, including corns (ICD-9 700; ICD-10 L84), keratoderma (ICD-9 701.1; ICD-10 L85.1), and acanthosis nigricans (ICD-9 701.2; ICD-10 L83), along with general epidermal thickening (ICD-10 L85). While the target list contains specific entries for these subtypes ('Corns and callosities', 'Keratoderma, acquired', 'Acquired acanthosis nigricans'), the target 'Other hypertrophic and atrophic conditions of skin' serves as the broader category (corresponding to the ICD-9 701 parent group) that encompasses these various forms of epidermal hypertrophy/thickening. Given the mixed nature of the source phenotype, the broader category is the most appropriate match.	L11.0;L83;L84;L85;L85.0;L85.1;L85.2;L85.3;L85.8;L85.9;L86;L87;L87.0;L87.2;L87.8;L87.9;L94.6
Hypothyroidism	True	Hypothyroidism	Hypothyroidism; Hypothyroidism NOS; Secondary hypothyroidism	"The source phenotype ""Hypothyroidism"" is defined by ICD codes encompassing congenital (243), acquired (244), and unspecified forms (E03). The target list contains the exact string match ""Hypothyroidism"", which is the most appropriate and comprehensive mapping for the broad condition. ""Hypothyroidism NOS"" is a valid synonym, while ""Secondary hypothyroidism"" represents a specific subset and is therefore less suitable."	E03;E03.0;E03.1;E03.2;E03.3;E03.5;E03.8;E03.9;E89.0;G13.2
Acne	True	Acne	Acne	The candidate list contains an exact string match for the source phenotype 'Acne', which shares the same dermatologic category and represents the same clinical condition.	L70;L70.0;L70.1;L70.2;L70.3;L70.4;L70.5;L70.8;L70.9;L73.0
Complications and ill defined descriptions of heart disease	True	Ill-defined descriptions and complications of heart disease	Ill-defined descriptions and complications of heart disease; Circulatory disease NEC; Other forms of chronic heart disease; Other heart block; Heart failure NOS	The source phenotype 'Complications and ill defined descriptions of heart disease' is a direct lexical and conceptual match for the target phenotype 'Ill-defined descriptions and complications of heart disease'. Both refer to the same category of heart conditions (often corresponding to ICD-9 code 429 series) that are not otherwise specified.	None
Inflammation of the eye	True	Inflammation of the eye	Inflammation of the eye; Infection of the eye; Keratitis; Conjunctivitis, infectious; Uveitis, noninfectious or NOS; Chorioretinal inflammations, scars, and other disorders of choroid; Disorders of conjunctiva; Disorders of iris and ciliary body; Disorders of the orbit; Eye infection, viral; Pain, swelling or discharge of eye	The source phenotype 'Inflammation of the eye' covers a broad range of inflammatory conditions of the globe and adnexa, encompassing conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, uveitis, and chorioretinitis (evidenced by ICD codes H10, H16, H15, H20, H30, etc.). The target list contains an exact string match, 'Inflammation of the eye', which is the most appropriate mapping as it matches both the name and the semantic scope of the source codes. Other matches such as 'Keratitis' or 'Conjunctivitis, infectious' are specific subsets and do not cover the full extent of the source phenotype.

Osteoarthritis of more than one site	True	Osteoarthrosis, generalized	Osteoarthrosis, generalized; Osteoarthrosis NOS; Osteoarthrosis; Osteoarthritis; localized; Osteoarthrosis, localized, primary; Osteoarthrosis, localized, secondary	The source phenotype 'Osteoarthritis of more than one site' corresponds to ICD-9 715.0 (Osteoarthrosis, generalized) and ICD-10 M15 (Polyosteoarthritis). The target phenotype 'Osteoarthrosis, generalized' is a semantic and code-based match for osteoarthritis affecting multiple sites, distinguishing it from localized forms.	M15;M15.0;M15.1;M15.2;M15.3;M15.4;M15.8;M15.9
Deviated nasal septum	True	Septal Deviations/Turbinate Hypertrophy	Septal Deviations/Turbinate Hypertrophy	The source phenotype 'Deviated nasal septum' is explicitly mentioned in the target phenotype 'Septal Deviations/Turbinate Hypertrophy'. This target combines septal deviations with turbinate hypertrophy, but it remains the specific and appropriate category for mapping the source condition.	J34.2
High risk human papillomavirus HPV DNA test positive	True	Abnormal Papanicolaou smear of cervix and cervical HPV	Abnormal Papanicolaou smear of cervix and cervical HPV; Viral warts & HPV; Sexually transmitted infections (not HIV or hepatitis); Cervical cancer and dysplasia; Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] [Cervical dysplasia]	The source phenotype is a specific laboratory finding ('High risk human papillomavirus HPV DNA test positive') typically associated with cervical cancer screening. The target phenotype 'Abnormal Papanicolaou smear of cervix and cervical HPV' specifically references both the context (cervical screening/Pap smear) and the specific agent (cervical HPV), making it the most precise semantic match. While 'Viral warts & HPV' mentions HPV, high-risk HPV strains are oncogenic and usually asymptomatic (detected via DNA test) rather than causing visible warts (associated with low-risk strains), making the screening/abnormal finding category more appropriate.

Laryngitis and tracheitis	True	Acute laryngitis and tracheitis	Acute laryngitis and tracheitis; Chronic laryngitis; Diseases of the larynx and vocal cords	The source phenotype 'Laryngitis and tracheitis' includes ICD codes for both acute (e.g., J04) and chronic (e.g., J37) forms of inflammation in the larynx and trachea. The candidate 'Acute laryngitis and tracheitis' is the best match as it explicitly covers both anatomical sites (larynx and trachea) mentioned in the source name. While the source includes chronic codes, the acute condition is chemically and structurally the closest descriptive match available in the target list that captures the 'tracheitis' component, unlike 'Chronic laryngitis' which is limited to the larynx.

Disorders of the cornea	True	Corneal opacity and other disorders of cornea	Corneal opacity and other disorders of cornea; Corneal opacity; Keratitis; Corneal ulcer; Corneal dystrophy; Corneal edema; Corneal degenerations; Keratoconus; Cornea replaced by transplant	The source phenotype 'Disorders of the cornea' encompasses a broad range of conditions including Keratitis (ICD-10 H16), Corneal scars/opacities (H17), and Other disorders of the cornea (H18). The target candidate 'Corneal opacity and other disorders of cornea' is the most comprehensive match, effectively covering the ICD-10 H17 and H18 blocks and serving as a broad grouping phenotype similar to the source. While 'Keratitis' and specific conditions like 'Corneal ulcer' are also present, they are too narrow to represent the entire source category.
